# Peernotify: anonymous notification service

## Abstract
In the last few years, there is a lot of movement towards decentralization
of the Internet services. Implementations of the ideas from 90's cypherpunk 
movement, namely persistent, immutable, content-addressed information 
resources, zero-trust economic activity tools like electronic cash and 
peer-to-peer marketplaces etc., have unexpectedly emerged within the 
cryptographic community of the last decade. Two of most prominent technologies
of that kind are distributed hash tables which are already widely adopted for
file sharing in the *BitTorrent* protocol, and more recent cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin, which builds on ideas of Wei Dai, Adam Back and David Chaum and
is per se probably the greatest invention since the Internet, but in its 
essense is just a distributed modification-resistant database.

TODO: 
- mix of those two technologies
- peernotify idea
